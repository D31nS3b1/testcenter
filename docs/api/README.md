# Api Documentation
These files have two purposes
- Define the backend-API for the api-tests (make backend-test-api)
- Get compiled for the API-documentation (make update-docs)

One third purpose could be to be the base for a Mock-Backend created with Spotlight/Prism.
But this is not implemented now.
