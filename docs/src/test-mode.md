# Modes for test execution

For the test or the survey, all execution parameters are given by
the XML definition files. But before the test starts in production (hot) mode, there is
the need to evaluate the test content and configuration. Then, some restrictions of the
test may make it really hard to evaluate. For example, it would take too much time if
you have to wait for the completion of all audio sequences. One could adapt the
test definition for the evaluation period, but this is dangerous: After evaluation, you
will change the test definition again and then risk new errors.

Our system allows multiple modes to run the test. Every login carries a token that declares
this mode. You can first review only the design of the units and its arrangement,
then switch on some restrictions and store responses, and finally evaluate the
test like a testtaker.
