\ndocument describes the ways to bring the parameters to the application and lists\nall possible keys.\nConfiguration file on the server\nThere is one file on the server where the application looks for booklet definitions:\n/config/bookletDefintions.jsonThis configuration is loaded at (re)start of the application and is applied for \nall booklets, if no other configuration is found. This is a simple JSON file with \nkey value pairs. Example:\n{\n    \"force_responses_complete\": \"OFF\",\n    \"unit_navibuttons\": \"ARROWS_ONLY\",\n...\n}The adminstrator of the server can upload this file. We aim at providing an \nadministration feature of the super-admin section of the application to manage \nthis configuration.\nConfiguration via booklet XML\nThe configuration can be set for every single booklet. You need to add one XML-Element \ninto the booklet-file. Example:\n...\n\n\n    OFF\n    ARROWS_ONLY\n...\nList of parameters\n\n    \n\n    \n        export class BookletConfig {\n\t// this file is generated by 'generateBookletConfigClass' script from

the test or the survey, all execution parameters are given by \nthe XML definition files. But before the test starts in production (hot) mode, there is \nthe need to evaluate the test content and configuration. Then, some restrictions of the \ntest may make it really hard to evaluate. For example, it would take too much time if \nyou have to wait for the completion of all audio sequences. One could adapt the \ntest definition for the evaluation period, but this is dangerous: After evaluation, you \nwill change the test definition again and then risk new errors.\nOur system allows multiple modes to run the test. Every login carries a token that declares \nthis mode. You can first review only the design of the units and its arrangement, \nthen switch on some restrictions and store responses, and finally evaluate the \ntest like a testtaker.   \n\n    \n\n    \n
