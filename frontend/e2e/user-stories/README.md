# User Stories
These documents will be the basis for 
* manually testing process
* E2E-tests programming

It will describe a set of basic paths through the application, 
including crucial edge-cases. It aims to ensure a basic set of
functionality but cannot exhaust every possible path. Testers 
should use this as a minimal guideline what is to test, but
should try out all edge-cases and variations they can imagine.
The goal for E2E-tests is to *at least* test those user stories,
other E2E-tests will follow.

New functionality should never be implemented without test 
E2E-Tests but must *at least* be described here.
